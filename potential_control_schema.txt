Example Ideas for control schema:
w-a-s-d: Classic controls (jump-left-right-crouch)
Blocking: To block, walk backwards (away from enemy)
###shift: Dash
q: punch (faster startup and recovery than kick)
    _-q: heavy punch
    d/a(side-dependent_-q: light punch (poke)
    w-q: anti-air punch
    s-q: low-profile punch
e: kick (longer range, (heavier damage?) than punch)
    _-q: heavy kick
    d/a(side-dependent_-q: light kick (poke)
    w-q: anti-air kick
    s-q: low-profile kick
f: super move

HOW TO CHEESE THE HITBOXES TO MAKE MY LIFE EASIER:
- THE POKES ARE JUST FASTER, LOWER DAMAGE HEAVIES
- ANTI-AIR AND LOW-PROFILE ARE JUST MATHEMATICALLY OPPOSITE WHERE APPLICABLE
